# Instructions for running CHT2531 JavaScript Exercises

1. Download and unzip or clone the repository.
2. Inside this folder there are a number of files. Here are the ones we are interested in:

* *index.html*. This is the HTML file that is used in practical exercises. Have a good look in *index.html*. Note that it has a link to the Leaflet library's CSS file, and the Leaflet JavaScript library itself. Note there is also an empty ```<div>``` element in the page. This is where the map will appear. This HTML file also uses a JavaScript file, exercises.js
* *exercises.js*. This is where you will write your JavaScript. It already contains some code to get you started. It also contains the exercise questions (in comments, leave these questions commented out).

Again like the previous weeks, you will need to run the example on a web server.
