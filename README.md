# Instructions for running CHT2531 JavaScript Exercises

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Unzip this.
3. Inside this folder there are a number of files. Here are the ones we are interested in:

* *index.html*. This is the HTML file that is used in practical exercises. This HTML file uses a JavaScript file, exercises.js
* *exercises.js*. Open this in a text editor of your choice. This is where you will write your JavaScript. It already contains some code to get you started. It also contains the exercise questions (in comments, leave these questions commented out).
